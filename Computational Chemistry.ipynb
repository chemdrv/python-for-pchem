    "\n",
    "The time it takes computers to do the calculations involved in computational chemistry spans orders of magnitude. For simple calculations on small molecules, a reasonably new laptop can do them in a few seconds. For high precision calculations on hundreds (or thousands) of atoms, a super-computer might need weeks. This guides choices in how a scientist might choose to interact with their software.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're doing simple calculations on small molecules. You could honestly set up this entire software stack to run locally. I'm not asking you to do it, because the installation is finicky. So I've set us up with ChemCompute, which has both a **lot** of compute capacity and exactly the software stack we're looking for. I'm also having you work in Jupyter notebooks, because I like how accessable they are for students.\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you want to install things locally, Psi4 has directions on their website, but you'll want WSL if you run Windows. But basically if you're not in our about to join the Bennett lab, it's just working harder for no good reason. And if you are in the Bennett lab, it'd still just be something you do for funsies.)\n",
    "\n",
    "But Psi4, the computational package we're working with, is research grade, and can span the range to really intense calculations. If you look through their website, or the resources MolSSI (https://education.molssi.org/resources.html) has for learning quantum chemistry, you'll see entirely different ways of interacting with the Psi4 package, that are more appropriate for research level uses."

    "Two notes about what I did there.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I reloaded the geometry of methane for each iteration. When you perform a geometry optimization, Psi4 saves the new geometry in the instance of that molecule, and uses it for future calculations. That means, if I didn't reload the file, then the output geometry from STO-3G would be used as the input geometry for 3-21G, in the above example. I want to see the geometry optimization performed on each basis set independently, so I grabbed a fresh copy of the initial geometry. If I was feeling really fancy, I'd start from a stretched C-H bond length.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unlike energy, we don't a priori expect a pattern for bond lengths or angles as we increase the size of the basis set. I would expect that, for a give type of basis set, increasing the number should show a trend, but there is no variational principle at work here, so it can go the other way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2b. On the other hand, notice how small the changes are - we're starting from an optimized geometry. It's all small changes. (Consider the percentage here.)"

    "# Part 2: Calculating normal modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's look at how to use Psi4 to generate normal mode frequencies, and then visualize them. You'll likely want to reference chem 302 or chem 405 notes here: I'm not going to teach you normal mode analysis here, just how to calculate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculating frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to switch molecules now and work with carbon dioxide. In the cells below, I'm going to define my molecule, check the point group, optimize the geometry, and check the point group again. (You should ask yourself why I'm checking the point group so often throughout this analysis.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's up with that geometry definition\n",
    "I'm defining the molecule using the third method I described above: a z-matrix. Here's a brief description of a z-matrix:\n",
    " - Each line is one atom\n",
    " - Atom `1` is just identified with it's symbol\n",
    " - Atom `2` gets it's symbol, and a bond length specified relative to atom `1`\n",
    " - Atom `3` gets symbol, bond length relative to `1`, angle relative to atom `2`\n",
    " - All further atoms get symbol, bond length, bond angle, and a dihedral angle\n",
    " - At this point we're just living in a new three coordinate system, where the coordinates are (bond length, bond angle, dihedral angle) all relative to previously defined atoms\n",
    " - Each row references previously defined atoms by number, 1-indexed\n",
    "\n",
    "You should read my definition of carbon dioxide below and verify that you understand how that string of letters and numbers is the geometry of CO2. It's really a lovely system once you learn it, but it takes a beat to learn.\n"

    "For some calculations, the point group of the molecule doesn't matter. The energy is the energy, no big deal. But, in order to calculate normal modes and properly assign them in a spectrum, we need to have a molecule that's in the right point group. We run into a funny problem here: rounding errors and sig figs. Think about the shape of methane in your head right now: it's a carbon in the middle, two hydrogens pointing out this way, two hydrogens pointing out the other side. In your head, you've defined it with exact angles. The computer projects this into cartesian coordinates. In the limit of infinite decimal places, these two representations are exactly the same thing: you project the angles into cartesian space and it's fine. But, once you round off, you can introduce a smidge of error. Similarly, if the computer is following an algorithm to relax a geometry to a minimum, it might relax this hydrogen a smidge this way and the next one a smidge another way. You and I both know that 1.082323 and 1.082324 are the same for all intents and purposes. But *technically* they're not the same bond length. If your molecule has those two bond lengths, then those bonds aren't symmetric. There are methods to tell Psi4 to chill with the decimal places, but I've had difficiulty always getting it to return the correct symmetry.\n",
